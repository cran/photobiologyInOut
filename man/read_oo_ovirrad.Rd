\title{Read File Saved by Ocean Optics' OceanView.}
\usage{
read_oo_ovirrad(
  file,
  date = NULL,
  geocode = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  tz = NULL,
  locale = readr::default_locale(),
  range = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{character string Path to the file to be read, following R's
use of forward slashes as separator for folder names.}

\item{date}{a \code{POSIXct} object to use to set the \code{"when.measured"}
attribute. If \code{NULL}, the default, the date is extracted from the
file header.}

\item{geocode}{A data frame with columns \code{lon} and \code{lat}, and
optionally \code{address} used to set attribute \code{"where.measured"}.}

\item{label}{character string to which to set the \code{"what.measured"} 
attribute. If \code{NULL} the value of \code{basename(file)} is used, 
and if \code{NA} the \code{"what.measured"} attribute is not set.}

\item{tz}{character A time zone recognized by R. If \code{NULL}, the default,
it is extracted from `locale`.}

\item{locale}{The locale controls defaults that vary from place to place. 
 The default locale is US-centric (like R), but you can use
\code{\link[readr]{locale}} to create your own locale that controls things
like the default time zone, encoding, decimal mark, big mark, and day/month
names. Its value must match that used to write the imported file, which
is not necessarily the default one or the local one.}

\item{range}{a numeric vector of length two, or any other object for which
function \code{range()} will return a range of wavelengths expressed in
nanometres.}
}
\value{
A \code{source_spct} object with columns \code{w.length} with
  wavelengths in nanometres and \code{s.e.irrad} with spectral energy
  irradiance in \eqn{W m^{-2} nm^{-1}}, attributes \code{comment},
  \code{what.measured}, \code{when.measured}, \code{how.measured},
  \code{where.measured} and \code{file.header} containing metadata for
  the spectrum.
}
\description{
Reads the spectral data and in addition parses the header of a energy
irradiance data file as output by OceanView. OceanView is a program from
Ocean Optics used to measure UV, visible and NIR radiation with array
spectrometers from the same company. OceanView replaces the no longer 
supported SpectraSuite program.
}
\details{
The header of the file is first decoded and parsed to extract the
  time of data acquisition and serial number of the spectrometer, and to
  locate the start of the spectral data. The fields are located by name.
  The spectral irradiance is re-expressed in \eqn{W m^{-2} nm^{-1}} and 
  returned as an object of class \code{\link[photobiology]{source_spct}} 
  with metadata stored in attributes \code{when.measured},
  \code{what.measured}, and \code{how.measured} set to values extracted from
  the header. The value stored in the \code{how.measured} attribute includes
  the User: and Serial Number: values extracted from the file header. 
  If an argument is passed to parameter \code{geocode}, its value is
  saved in attribute \code{where.measured}. The file header in whole
  is copied to attribute \code{file.header}. The object's \code{comment}
  always gives a text that includes the file name, time of import, function
  name and the version of packages 'photobiology' and 'photobiologyInOut' 
  used.
