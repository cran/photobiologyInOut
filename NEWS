=======================================

* Track changes in 'tidyr' (= 1.0.0).
* Move packages 'pavo' and 'hyperSpec' to suggests.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.20 (2019-06-08)
=======================================

* Track changes in 'photobiology' (= 0.9.28) and 'dplyr' (= 0.8.1).
* Set "how.measured" attribute in file import functions.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.19 (2018-12-11)
=======================================

* Add checks for non-ASCII characters in headers.
* Track code breaking change in 'readr' (>= 1.3.0).

photobiologyInOut 0.4.18 (2018-11-22)
=======================================

* Track code breaking change in 'readr' (>= 1.2.0).
* Fix bug in read_oo_pidata() that was preventing reading of Ocean Optics 
"Raspberry Pi"  Flame files with a sequence header line at the top.
* Add decoding of file header to extract integration time and number of scans 
to read_oo_pidata().
* Improve decoding of file header to extract instrument settings in 
read_oo_jazdata().

photobiologyInOut 0.4.17 (2018-09-27)
=====================================

* Add new function to read transmittance and reflectance files from Ocean 
Optics' Jaz modular spectrometer.
* Fix bug in decoding of time and date in functions read_fmi2mspct(), 
read_tuv_usrout() and read_qtuv_txt(). Decoding failed under R 3.4.4 (oldrel) 
but worked under R 3.5.1 due to functions from 'lubridate' returning POSIXlt 
values instead of POSIXct values. Now we force conversion to POSIXct.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.16 (2018-08-30)
=====================================

Revise read_fmi_dat() to extract date from file header and save the file header
to the spectral object as a comment.
Add read_fmi2mspct() for reading spectral irradiance.
Bug fix: decoding of dates in fmi import functions for daily data not always 
returned POSIXct objects triggering errors in downstream code.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.15 (2018-08-10)
=====================================

Add read_yoctopuce_csv() to read CSV files from YoctoPuce modules.

Quick TUV calculator.
Add read_tuv_usrout2mspct() wrapper of read_tuv_usrout() and subset2mspct().
Revise read_tuv_usrout() with new formal parameter ozone.du and fix a bug in
the setting of "where.measured" attribute.
Revise all read functions so that they store the header of the imported file as
a vector of character strings to attribute "file.header".

photobiologyInOut 0.4.14 (2018-04-03)
=====================================

Implement class coercion methods ("as." methods) to complement earlier functions,
tracking 'photobiology' 0.9.20.
Move coercion methods from and to matrix objects to 'photobiology' 0.9.20.
Update to track API changes in 'colorSpec' 0.7-3.
Translate vignette to Rmarkdown.

Add function read_ASTER_txt() (read files ASTER materials reflectance database).
Revise function read_licor_prn() to accept transmittance and reflectance spectra
in addition to energy and photon irradiance spectra.
Improve handling of 'label' by using only the base name of files and appending
user supplied label text.
Change location of external data used in vignettes.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.12
========================

Fix CITATION file.
Add function read_uvspec_disort(), rename read_libradtran_vesa() to
read_uvspec_disort_vesa().

photobiologyInOut 0.4.11
========================

Edit read_licor_prn() to work around a bug in readr::read_table() that results
in missread data (wrong numbers).
Add read_csi_dat() to read data saved from modern Campbell Scientific loggers.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.10
========================

Make compatible with upcoming version of package 'lubridate' (pull request by
vspinu NA).
Add function read_avaspec_xls() which can import spectral data from Excel
files exported from Avantes software.
Fix code to avoid partial matches of function parameter names (tz -> tzone).

photobiologyInOut 0.4.9
=======================

Fix LaTeX error in vignette.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.8
=======================

Replace a couple of NA returned by read fucntions with empty spectral objects.
Improve handling of strict.range to avoid spurious warnings.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.7
=======================

Add functions mspct2matrix() and matrix2mspct for conversion of collections 
of spectra into R matrices and vice-versa.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.6
=======================

Fix bug introduced when attempting to make the package pass CRAN checks
without triggering a note.

photobiologyInOut 0.4.5
=======================

Fix for compatibility with 'dplyr' (> 0.4.3). 
Add functions to exchange data with package 'colorSpec':
colorSpec2spct(), colorSpec2chroma_spct(), colorSpec2mspct(), spct2colorSpec(),
chroma_spct2colorSpec(), and mspct2colorSpec().
Add or revise functions to exchange data with package 'hyperSpec':
spct2hyperSpec(), mspct2hyperSpec(), hyperSpec2spct() and hyperSpec2mspct().
Add import function for raw counts from Ocean Optics instruments accessed
through server running on a Raspberry Pi board: read_oo_pidata().

photobiologyInOut 0.4.4
=======================

Add 'readr::locale' support to all functions that could make use of it.
Add 'label' parameter to all file import functions.
Add function read_oo_ssdata() for reading SpectraSuite files containing raw 
counts.

multiple solar spectrum simulations (as preprocessed by Vesa's script).
Add metadata as consistently as possible to the objects returned by all the 
file import functions.
Update dependencies.
Edit the user Guide.
WARNING: from version 0.4.4 the time zone (tz) is by default "UTC" for decoding
dates and times in files imported. In most cases you will need to pass the
tz (or the locale) where the file was created as an argument to the functions!

photobiologyInOut 0.4.3
=======================

Update for compatibility with 'lubridate' (>= 1.5.6)
Add function read_oo_jazdata() to read Jaz files containing raw counts.
Add preliminary versions of functions to exchange data with package 'hyperSpec':
mspct2hyperSpec() and hyperSpec2mspct().
Add preliminary version of function to import data from package 'pavo':
rspec2mspct().

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.4.2
===========================

Fix bug in read_fmi_cum(). Update dependencies.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.4.1
===========================

Update vignette. Fix docs.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.4.0
===========================

This is a major update, not backwards compatible, as names and formal 
parameters of all functions have changed. Trimming is no longer supported
(should be done as a separate operation).

The functions for Ocean Optics files now read the number of pixels from the
file header, and hopefully will better adjust to different instruments and 
settings.

Functions for reading multiple spectra now return collections of spectra.
(Functions that saved the spectral objects constructed from the data read 
from text files on disk back to disk as R data files have been removed.)

New functions for reading daily spectral exposure data from files returned
by models from FMI have been added.

New function for reading .csv file from Avantes' AvaSpec spectrometers added.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.2
===========================

Add "use.hinges" argument to functions, and default to not adding hinges when
trimming input.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.1
===========================

Remove dependency on data.table.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.0
===========================

Corrected some bugs in read_licor_files()

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.2.1
===========================

Added function to read spectral irradiance files generated by the Jaz spectrometer
from Ocean Optics.

Functions names shortened.

Expanded the User Guide.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.2.0
===========================

Edited read_licor_prn_files() drastically. The new version is functionally 
equivalent but formal arguments have changed. In addition it is now implemented 
by calling read_licor_prn_file().

New functions read_licor_prn_file(), read_macam_dta_file(), 
read_ooss_txt_file() and read_tuv_file() returning source.spct objects.

Function read_xlsx() removed as there are other packages available for Excel
file import.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.3
===========================

Added function read.xlsx() for reading data from Excel workbook files saved 
as .xlsx (zipped XML format). 

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.2
===========================

Added parameter unit.out and cleaned code.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.0
===========================

First version containing only one function for importing data measured with 
a LI-COR LI-1800 spectroradiometer from .PRN text files produced by the 
PC1800 MS-DOS program from LI-COR.
